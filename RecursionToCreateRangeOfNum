//This took a little bit haha! Kept trying to use push, actually decided that it was doing the loop backwards not the other way around.

function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
  if (startNum == endNum)
  {
    return [startNum];
  }
  else
  {
    var numbers = rangeOfNumbers(startNum + 1, endNum);
    numbers.unshift(startNum)
    console.log(numbers);
    return numbers;
  }
};

console.log(rangeOfNumbers(1,5));
